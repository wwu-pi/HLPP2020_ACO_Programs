This repository contains the programs used for measureing runtimes of parallel implementations of the ACO Algorithm. It has two parts: 
1. Musket_Program -> a high-level version generated with the Musket framework (https://github.com/wwu-pi/musket_dsl)
2. A Hand-written version

Attention! Local paths might need to be adjusted to run the programs.
